At this day and age, the advancements of technology has resulted in more and more dating apps being developed. 
This story is about a online relationship that ends up in despair.

Story: Many people think that dating apps are rip offs. Johny, for one, strongly disagree with such unfounded accusations. 
In school, his poor looks and pathetic features makes him a clown in front of the school's popular girls.
Additionally, he is also a clumsy pig and tends to make a fool of himself in front of them.
Oh, how much does poor little Johny wish that his could become just slightly more attractive. 
But then one magnificent day, a ground-breaking app was released--Tinder!
When Johny saw this new app, he was absolutely delighted!
Instantaenously, photoshopped-images of his body flashed across his childish mind.
He wondered, hoho, after my transformation online, my dating chance will surely sky-rocket.
